    "- What is the average trip duration for a borrowed bicycle?\n",
    "- What is the most common age of a bicycle-sharer?\n",
    "- Given all the weather data, what is the average precipitation per month? the median?\n",

    "- When a bike station is modified, is it more likely to gain or lose bikes? how do we know this?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does use of stations by short-term-pass-holders have any correlation to above or below average precipitation? if so what is the correlation?\n",
    "- What is the average length of a trip?\n",
    "- What is the most common route for a trip?\n",
